# Cluster 5 Group 4 Project

## File Descriptions:
#### player coords thing.py
Coordinate system with piano anchor point at (-10, 0). User can walk around the coordinate plane with up/down/right/left arrows and the location of the sound they hear changes accordingly. Player's current coordinates are printed in the console.

#### pyoExample.py
User can move sound to the left and right with the "left" and "right" arrow keys. They can also use "up" to move forward. As the user moves forward, the first white-noise sound becomes quieter, until it eventually stops after the user moves forward 4 steps. At that point, a second sound starts playing.

#### HauntedProject1.py
When user presses the "up" arrow, forward footsteps start playing.
